Problem came from ABC-133C.

#### Install
1. **Move .config/ into ~ (the home dir).**  
2. vim ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/plugins-setup.lua  
3. And then type :w for download the plug  

#### Pre
Make sure there are files named 'in' and 'sol' in your directory.  
Just like **screenshot**.  
Or you can edit keymaps.lua for custom your file name
Your should copy the case into 'in' file.  

#### HotKey for CP
\<leader\> is your 'space' key.    
\<leader\>sa  :  save all    
\<F5\>        :  compile and run the code(make sure 'in' file is ok)
